CHIP-8
==============


This is yet another CHIP-8 emulator, mostly to practice stuff I should write on in more detail here.

### Dependencies

[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org) and [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog), just because I love the simplicity of both SDL and spdlog I guess.


#### Hey this is a pretty lackluster README!

Yes, I know.
